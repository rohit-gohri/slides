# CI

#### <Tomato>Or how to automate the boring parts</Tomato>

<Notes>

Hello everyone!

Today I'm going to talk about the CI part of CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery), or as how I like to call it, 'How to automate the boring parts'

<Notes>

First, a little about me. My name is Rohit Gohri, I am a Sr. Software Developer at CollegeDunia.

I am a full stack developer with a keen interest in DevOps, I love optimising developer workflows and working on devloper tooling.

# What Is Continuous Integration?

</Small>

<Notes>

The process of continuously testing/building/etc your code as you **push** it so that
- problems get detected early
- your main branch is never in a broken state, and
- it is **always** deployable

</Notes>

---

# Why should you care?

<Notes>

- Single source of truth: No more "But it works on my machine"
- Enforce common rules for teams: Have a linting config? Have a codestyle? Want to enforce sepecific folder structures? Everything can be checked by the CI
- Faster/Better Code Reviews: Having the basic stuff automatically checked leaves the reviewer to focus on the code

</Notes>

## Prerequisites for <Tomato>CI</Tomato>

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>Automated Setup/Containerization</li>
        <li>Testability</li>
        <li>Reproducibility</li>
        <li><Tomato>Culture</Tomato></li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

There are some things that your project & team need to have before you start this journey.

- **Automated Setup**: Using things like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) to make your code portable and easier to run on any machine and/or environments, or using Infrastructure as Code tools like [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/quickstart.html) to setup systems in an automated way

- **Testability**: Your code should be testable in an automatic fashion. Could be unit tests, integration tests, api tests through Postman, or UI testing.

- **Reproducibility**: Test results should be same in different environments and on repeat runs

- **Culture**: All of this if useless if you or your team members don't follow the process all of you set for yourselves. A failing CI pipeline is useless if the branch gets merged anyway.

There are also some implicit ones that aren't mentioned like having a version control system (like Git), a Pull/Merge Request based check-in system, etc.

# Tools of the Trade

- [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [Drone.io](https://drone.io/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
- [JetBrains TeamCity](https://jenkins.io/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
- .....

<Notes>

There are lots of options in the market now.
- Size
  - Big (Microsoft - Azure)
  - Small (Drone.io)
- Model
  - SaaS (Azure)
  - Self-hosted(Jenkins)
  - Both (Drone, Gitlab)
  - Mixed: SaaS + Self Hosted Runners (Gitlab/Github).

A lot of them are also free for open source projects! So there is no excuse to not use these on your next personal project.

There are also small niche tools that plug into your existing infra, eg. DangerJS (adding custom project specific checks), Relative-CI (for comparing bundle-sizes), CodeCov for coverage, CodeClimate, etc. These work alongside/through your option of choice above.

# Pipelines & YAML

<Notes>

The code that runs on every push/event is termed as Pipelines. Different providers have different naming conventions.

YAML(Yet Another Markup Language) is file format for declaring static information, it is used by a lot of popular Infrastructure as Code tools and most CI servers.
The format is different for each Server.

</Notes>

# Demo

<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
    <img src={QRCode} style={{width: '30vw'}}/>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <div style={{display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', fontSize: '32px'}}>
        github.com/rohit-gohri/hello-ci-frontend
    </div>
</div>

<Notes>

<Tomato>Send link to slack channel at this time</Tomato>

So for the demo I have already set up a simple repository on Github with create-react-app.

It would be great if you could take out your laptops and open the link

I have added configs for 4 CI providers in one single repo. You can check how they are setup later.
- Github
- Gitlab
- Drone
- Travis

# Make Some <Tomato>Changes</Tomato>
<!-- TODO: Ask to do some specific change or let them do whatever. Want to see a mix of failing and passing pipelines -->

- Fork the project
- Clone it
- Create and checkout to a new branch: `git checkout -b demo`
- Do `npm i`
- Start the website: `npm start`
- Change something

<Notes>

Could be:
- Add a component OR
- Change some styling OR
- Something else

</Notes>

---

# Open a PR

- Commit and push your code
- Open the Demo repository and Create a new PR
- Wait for results from CI

---

# Let's see some results

<Notes>

Already have 2 PRs open already (one passing and one failing).
Wait for people to do this.

- Show some results
- one failing
- one passing
- different providers
- Lastly focus on Gitlab CI results to associate with next slide

</Notes>

# How did this happen?

Let's look at one example config: `.gitlab-ci.yml`

---

<CodeSurfer theme={codeTheme} title=".gitlab-ci.yml">

```yaml file=../static/code/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 3 title="Base Docker Image" file=../static/code/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 5:7 title="ENV VAR overrides" file=../static/code/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 16:28 title="The different stages" file=../static/code/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 13:14 title="Runs before every stage" file=../static/code/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

It is written in YAML. This file defines a pipeline that will be run whenever you push your code. Some providers allow triggering multiple pipelines. Let's look a little closer:

CodeSnippets:

1. This is the base (Docker) image on which each stage of the pipeline will be run
2. Any env variable overrides can be specified
  - Can be used to turn off some features
  - Or Logging/Monitoring/etc.
3. These are stages defined that we saw in the UI
4. This script runs before every job in the pipeline

</Notes>

---

# Let's Add A New Stage

lint: `npm run lint`

<Notes>

Now that you have seen a basic pipeline config, and seen the result of one in a project. Let's try to extend it.

We have a linter(eslint) setup already in `package.json`. You can run it through the given command.

Every pipeline has 2 steps currently: test & build. Let's ensure that the code is linted properly before we do any of those.

</Notes>

<CodeSurfer theme={codeTheme}>

```yaml 16:28 title="The different stages" file=../static/code/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 16:34 title="The different stages" file=../static/code/lint.gitlab-ci.yml
```

</CodeSurfer>

# Some Advanced Usage Patterns

---

<CodeSurfer
  theme={codeTheme}>

```yaml 21:28 title="Publish NPM Package" file=../static/code/npm.drone.yml
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

NPM modules can automatically be published after building and testing on every git tag release.

</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  theme={codeTheme}>

```yaml 10:16 title="Build Docs" file=../static/code/docs.drone.yml
```

```yaml 18:32 title="Publish Docs" subtitle="Using Github Pages" file=../static/code/docs.drone.yml
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Docs can be generated from a Swagger file, JSDoc/JavaDoc, Postman collection etc.
- And published to free static hosting like github pages, etc.

</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  theme={codeTheme}>

```yaml 38:41 title="Deploy the Code" file=../static/code/trigger.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 43:51 title="Trigger Downstream Pipelines" file=../static/code/trigger.gitlab-ci.yml
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Automated deploys can be initiated by the CI
  - SSH keys and other secrets can be provided through env variables
- Pipelines can be triggered for dependent projects after every release


NOTE: Open sapphire pipelines after this
